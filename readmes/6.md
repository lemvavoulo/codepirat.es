Title: Kix Standalone Editor

Google recently unveiled a radically improved rich text editor for use with
Google Docs [1], apparently code-named Kix.  Although they have not released
the source code for this editor, nor have they stated any intention of doing
so, Google's record of open-source releases (Chromium, Etherpad, &c.) gives me
hope that they will some day share their innovations with the broader
community of web developers.

Until that day arrives, this repository represents an experiment in turning
Kix into a standalone editor.  If this experiment violates Google's terms of
service, I must plead ignorance.  Ask me to take it down and I will readily
comply, as I mean no harm to Google.
